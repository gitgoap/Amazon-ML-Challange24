## Project: Product Attribute Extraction from Images

We participated in Amazon ML Challenge 2024 with a solution for extracting product attributes from images. Our approach uses the **Moondream Vision Language Model (VLM)**, which processes images from the `test.csv` file to extract specific attributes like weight, dimensions, and more.

### Key Highlights:
- **Moondream VLM** (1.6B parameters) was used for lightweight image-to-text processing.
- Extracted key product attributes using targeted prompts.
- Output cleaning and standardization were done using regex for consistency.
